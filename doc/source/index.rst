Welcome to nova-powervm's documentation!
========================================

This project provides a Nova-compatible compute driver for `PowerVM`_ systems.

The project aims to integrate into OpenStack's Nova project.  Initial
development is occurring in a separate project until it has matured and met the
Nova core team's requirements.  As such, all development practices should
mirror those of the Nova project.

Documentation on Nova can be found at the `Nova Devref`_.
