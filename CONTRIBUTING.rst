Contributing to Nova-PowerVM
============================
If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer"
section of this page:

   https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

    https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova-powervm
